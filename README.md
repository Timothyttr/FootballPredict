# FootballPredict
Me and a couple of friends have a group where we bet on games throughout the year, for 3 leagues: La Liga, Prem and Eredivisie.

As i am trash in the prediction i am almost in last place as of the winter break.
In this break I attempt to create a new machine learning model to predict these scores.

First i need to collect data, I have previously written down thoughts on the project which I will give:
Prob important:
- All game stats and results
- Every player's stats per game
- which players in which team
- Extra weight -> player + team performance 
- Extra weight last season, heaviest weight current season
- If at home or away
- line up
- coach type of play

First we start of with pre processing. And finding the data.

- England - https://www.football-data.co.uk/englandm.php
- Spain - https://www.football-data.co.uk/spainm.php

Notes for Football Data

All data is in csv format, ready for use within standard spreadsheet applications. Please note that some abbreviations are no longer in use (in particular odds from specific bookmakers no longer used) and refer to data collected in earlier seasons. For a current list of what bookmakers are included in the dataset please visit http://www.football-data.co.uk/matches.php

Fouls make up the vast majority of Free Kicks Conceded. Free Kicks Conceded are shown when specific data on Fouls are not available (France 2nd, Belgium 1st and Greece 1st divisions).

Note also that English and Scottish yellow cards do not include the initial yellow card when a second is shown to a player converting it into a red, but this is included as a yellow (plus red) for European games.
