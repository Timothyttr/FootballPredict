# FootballPredict
Me and a couple of friends have a group where we bet on games throughout the year, for 3 leagues: La Liga, Prem and Eredivisie.

As i am trash in the prediction i am almost in last place as of the winter break.
In this break I attempt to create a new machine learning model to predict these scores.

First i need to collect data, I have previously written down thoughts on the project which I will give:
Prob important:
- All game stats and results
- Every player's stats per game
- which players in which team
- Extra weight -> player + team performance 
- Extra weight last season, heaviest weight current season
- If at home or away
- line up
- coach type of play

First we start of with pre processing. And finding the data.
